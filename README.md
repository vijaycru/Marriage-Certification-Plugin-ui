# Marriage-Certification-Plugin-ui
 
Initial iteration of the chat UI for your reference.

Additional notes:
– Default to open, keeping the chat open on load
– The icon is a placeholder at the moment. We will perhaps use ZC or create one for this purpose.
– We will be using a system sans-serif similar to Civic Compass. 
– I want to test the color scheme in production against the Kaveri site before finalising one.
Use the above mockups as a reference for spacing and font sizes. After the initial implementation, we can fine-tune this in production.

– Typing into the text input will change the microphone icon to the send icon. This behaviour is similar to most chat applications like WhatsApp.
– The microphone interaction needs more detailing to indicate recording, an option to delete after recording, etc (last priority)

Reminder :
- Code Clean-up
- Proper HTML tag needs to change (last priority)
- Accessibility at least Keyboard access (last priority)
